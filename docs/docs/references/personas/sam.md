- As a research data scientist I want to use ML to measure and optimise the costs, performance, efficiency and reliability of our company’s infrastructure to deliver the best experience to our customers.
- As a research data scientist I want to implement and test out new approaches both on toy test tasks as well as on actual application scenarios.

---

- Python
- Machine Learning frameworks
- SQL
- Dask
- VSCode, Jupyter notebooks

## 🌮 Core needs

---

- Collaboration with engineering, product and the rest of the DS team
- Ability to track experiments, models, data, accuracy, metrics reliably
- Ability to access scalable compute on-demand

## 🐛 Pain points or biggest challenges

---

- Cannot scale the compute resources without having to go through infrastructure approval
- Not easy way to track experiments, data lineage, and workflow artefacts
- Do not understand git well enough
