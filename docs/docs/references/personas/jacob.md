- As an ML Engineer with good DevOps skills and not much time, I want to build MLOps pipelines efficiently so that I don’t waste time on tedious tasks.

---

- Python, PyTorch
- Git, GitHub
- AWS, GCP
- Argo
- DVC, ClearML, Tensorboard
- CI/CD platform
- K8s, Dask

## 🐛 Pain points or biggest challenges

---

- Rigid pipelining tools limit flexibility to build pipelines that meet my specific constraints.
- Limited or incomplete documentation (just hello world examples) doesn’t give me enough information to build the complex configuration I need without a lot of trial and error testing.

## 🌮 Core needs

---

- Efficient access to infrastructure
- Elevated privileges to experiment with different configurations and for transparency into background tasks
- Documentation that shows how to implement common pipeline configurations
- Templates/base configurations with several different scenarios
- Flexible pipelining platform that allows experimentation and custom solutions
