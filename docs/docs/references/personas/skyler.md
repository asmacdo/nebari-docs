- As a ML engineer I want to work across teams and functions -- software engineers, ML engineers, data scientists, researchers, and product managers to understand user problems and build engineering solutions.
- As a ML Engineer I want to work with ML engineers and related teams to integrate ML components into the system and solve their performance issues

---

- Docker
- CI/CD platforms
- Python, Go, bash
- VSCode and Vim
- Flyte, Kubeflow
- GCP, Azure, AWS, DO
- Dask
- Git, GitHub, GitLab

## 🌮 Core needs

---

- highly collaborative and extensible tooling and platform
- enforcement of best practices
- safe and efficient access to both the data and the infrastructure
- elevated privileges to experiment in “staging or pre-production” environments

## 🐛 Pain points or biggest challenges

---

- Lack of best practices across other sides of the organisation makes my job really hard
- I am not sure if the models in production have bugs or the data is no longer accurate, need better monitoring tools
