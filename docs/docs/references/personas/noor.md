- As a student, I want to learn how to use Python to get a job in software development after I graduate.
- I’m learning how to code. I know I need an environment, but someone else creates and manages them. I never modify an environment myself (either through conda or pip)

---

- Python
- VScode and Jupyter notebooks
- conda, pip

## 🌮 Core needs

---

- simple and intuitive platform
- easy sharing and collaboration
- ability to experiment without worrying about “breaking things”

## 🐛 Pain points or biggest challenges

---

- I do not know how to share my work with friends and peers
