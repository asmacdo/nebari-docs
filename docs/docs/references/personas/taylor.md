- I maintain my org’s Nebari deployment. I make sure the infrastructure as code is maintained and that everyone has the conda environments or other resources they need.
- As a DevOps engineer I want to automate away as much of the day to day as possible - “Run By Robots” is the goal to minimise issues and make out team more efficient.
- Identify, respond to and collaborate with support and product teams to resolve production and customer issues and incidents.

## 🐛 Pain points or biggest challenges

---

- The organisation still relies on many manual operations
- There is so much technical debt - we can lose all of our infrastructure easily

## 🌮 Core needs

---

- Rely on automation as much as needed
- Have a product and security first approach to data and SWE
- Have organisation wide best practices for monitoring, alerting and incident management
- Ensure the whole company adheres to best practices
