# Taylor

Age bracket: 30-45  
Role: Sr. Dev Ops Engineer  
Reports to: Head of Software Engineering  
Nebari user group: admin

- I maintain my org’s Nebari deployment. I make sure the infrastructure as code is maintained and that everyone has the conda environments or other resources they need.
- As a DevOps engineer I want to automate away as much of the day to day as possible - “Run By Robots” is the goal to minimise issues and make out team more efficient.
- Identify, respond to and collaborate with support and product teams to resolve production and customer issues and incidents.
