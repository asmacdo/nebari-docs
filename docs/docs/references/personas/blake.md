- Nebari is a place I go to do my everyday programming work. I use conda envs, jupyter, and write code in vscode. I deploy dashboards with cds dashboards. I create packages and I need to pip install the dev versions into my environment.
- As a SWE I want to be able to collaborate with the Data and Engineering teams to build new prototypes for products

---

- VSCode
- Jupyter notebooks
- conda, pip
- Python and stack
- Plotly, Altair, etc.

## 🐛 Pain points or biggest challenges

## 🌮 Core needs

- Need to be able to create prototypes efficiently and run experiments with product and data teams
- ability to ship products without being held up in the process
- ability to manage my environment and tooling
