- As a CEO I am interested in knowing how the data teams are helping us improve our processes and revenue streams.
- I don’t know anything about programming or jupyter. As the CEO I want to click on a button or email, sign in, and see informative dashboards and metrics.
- I want to have a clear breakdown of costs from my departments.
