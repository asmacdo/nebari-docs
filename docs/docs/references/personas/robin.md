- As the head of Data Science I want to make sure my team has all the tools and data needed to be successful in their job.
- As the HDS I want to have executive buy-in to grow the data practice in house to improve our internal processes and better serve our customers.
- As the HDS I want to not have to spend half of my budget in proprietary platforms.
- As the HDS I want to work with organisation leadership to help establish long-term vision, strategy and roadmap for one or more teams
