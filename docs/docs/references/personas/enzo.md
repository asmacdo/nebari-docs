- As an ML Engineer in a startup, I have good modeling and coding skills, but I want to build MLOps pipelines as easily as possible, without having to learn DevOps first, so that I can efficiently test and productionize my models.

---

- Python, PyTorch
- Git, GitHub
- AWS, GCP
- Argo
- DVC, ClearML, Tensorboard
- CI/CD platform
- K8s, Dask

## 🐛 Pain points or biggest challenges

---

- Lack of DevOps experience makes pipeline implementation difficult, time consuming, and error prone.
- Limited high-level access to pipeline tools means that they are essentially black boxes to me (can’t see logs, not sure what’s happening when something breaks)

## 🌮 Core needs

---

- Safe and efficient access to infrastructure without breaking things
- Elevated privileges to experiment with different configurations and for transparency into background tasks
- Documentation that shows how to implement common pipeline configurations
- Templates/base configurations with several different scenarios
